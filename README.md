## Predicting Project Themes Based on Facial Features


This is another learning project.  As an applicant to the Insight Data Science Fellows program, I spent a bit of time looking at the 
previous fellows and their projects while at Insight in order to give me some ideas on a demonstration project for a programming portfolio here on Github. The page with descriptions of past fellows (www.insightdatascience.com/fellows) contains a long list of headshots with a title of their projcect.  Maybe a little too literal, but the idea came to me to try to predict the type of project a fellow will do based on their photo.  This will require webscraping the photo, scraping the project title and any descriptions, working with a facial analysis package, and then hopefully integrating all this together with a machine learning algorithm to predict the type of project.  It very well could be that there is no correlation, and a null result sometimes is helpful.  What is most helpful in this case is the learning experience, since this is the second program I have written. 

If you are going to follow along, be sure to make your own storage bank of the photos.  Those will not be posted here.
